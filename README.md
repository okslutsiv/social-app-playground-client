## Day formatting

[Day.js](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs) is a minimalist JavaScript library that parses, validates, manipulates, and displays dates and times for modern browsers with a largely Moment.js-compatible API. If you use Moment.js, you already know how to use Day.js.

Was used with plugin RelativeTime in 'screamCard.js'.
